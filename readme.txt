Adds a new setting under Settings -> Media where an admin can set a maximum upload file size for image files.

== Description ==

Many users do not compress or resize their images before uploading them into a post, and oftentimes WordPress's maximum upload limit of 2MB-10MB is still too large to prevent the insertion of photos that can signficantly slow down a website.

WP Image Size Limit allows an administrator to set a custom file size limit that is specific to image files and smaller than WordPress's general file size limit.

This is especially useful when you need to put tighter restriction on image uploads but want to preserve the ability to upload larger files of other formats (audio, video, etc.).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the zip file from this plugin on your plugins page or search for `Image Size Limit` and install it directly from the plugin directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' page in WordPress.
1. Go to Settings -> Media and set up the limit for your images.
